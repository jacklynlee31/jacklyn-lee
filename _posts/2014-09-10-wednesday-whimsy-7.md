It&#8217;s the middle of the week, which means it&#8217;s time for some whimsy! It&#8217;s finally getting cooler over here, which means it&#8217;s almost time for cardigans, scarves and hot tea. I definitely can&#8217;t wait. Check out these links I rounded up and don&#8217;t forget to share your own at the bottom!

I am in love with fruit + water. <a href="http://thebeautydepartment.com/2014/09/fruit-infused-water/" target="_blank">Check out these combinations from The Beauty Department</a>. Just looking at these makes me thirsty.

Honestly, there&#8217;s nothing better than <a href="http://instagram.com/p/sisyVZSE27/?modal=true" target="_blank">spending some quality time with a furry friend</a>.

In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been considering picking up a cactus for my desk. <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-to-become-a-cactus-collector-the-gardenist-195815" target="_blank">Can we please discuss these adorable cacti?</a> I need a cactus garden, stat!

Anyone who knows me knows I love Fall Out Boy.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCbS-TLEoRA" target="_blank">They came out with a new song on Monday and I can&#8217;t stop listening</a>.

<a href="http://xomisse.com/" target="_blank">XOMISSE</a> has some of the best advice when it comes to blogging and design. Some of my favorites include <a href="http://xomisse.com/blog/stay-out-of-legal-trouble-get-to-know-copyright-law/" target="_blank">a guide to copyright and fair use</a>, and <a href="http://xomisse.com/blog/avoid-blogging-burnout-overcome-bloggers-block/" target="_blank">how to overcome bloggers block</a>.

I definitely needed this in college: <a href="http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2014/09/buy-buy-dollar-store.html" target="_blank">Jillee has a list of things to buy and not to buy at the Dollar Store</a>. Definitely useful if you&#8217;re a student (or if you&#8217;re just poor, like me!)

Not only is <a href="http://www.helloluvvy.com/" target="_blank">their website adorable, but the ladies from Hello Luvvy</a> are also from Arkansas! Definitely worth checking out.

<a href="http://blog.freepeople.com/2014/09/techniques-portrait/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+freepeoplefeed+%28Free+People+Clothing+Boutique+Blog%29" target="_blank">Julie from Free People talks about how to take a better self-portrait</a>. These are awesome, AWESOME tips for anyone taking a new self-portrait or selfie!
