** <span style="color: #45818e;">procrastination does not yield inspiration nor does it yield motivation</span>**.&nbsp;

  ‘Procrastination’ is a term thrown around during High School and College when a student waits until the last minute to finish a paper or lays around when he or she should be working on a project.&nbsp; The term is met with humor, however has anyone stopped to realize how damaging this can be?&nbsp; Procrastination is a serious thing, and is something that can detrimentally hurt a student’s chances of success. &nbsp;&nbsp;As students, it is up to us to stop brushing procrastination aside as something ‘everyone does’.&nbsp; We need to take control of our procrastination and find ways to combat it.

  For me, the most successful way to combat procrastination is also the hardest way: <b><span style="color: #45818e;">Take the first step</span></b>.&nbsp; Today, for instance, I had to make some phone calls for my internship.&nbsp; I kept making excuses as to why I simply ‘couldn’t do it’, when finally I typed in the first number and called, forcing myself not to pick up the phone until I heard the first ring.&nbsp; This may seem silly, but it helped me to not hang up the phone before it started ringing, or to wander off and do something else.&nbsp; For me, hitting that call button was the first step, and I had a much easier time continuing the calls from there.

  What are you putting off today?&nbsp; Whatever it is, take that first step.&nbsp; <b><span style="color: #45818e;">With that first step comes clarity, focus and drive.&nbsp; By taking that first step you are letting yourself know that you mean business.</span></b>
