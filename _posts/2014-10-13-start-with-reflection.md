After you finish an assignment or project, it is always good to look back on the work you&#8217;ve done and ask yourself what you&#8217;ve done right and what you could have done better. This can help you move on to your next project with a clearer vision of what you want your outcome to be.

Over the past few years, however, I have realized how important it is to start and end with reflection. Although it is usually saved for the end of a project, starting with reflection can help you to get an idea of where you are and where you want to be.

Before you start a new project, ask yourself:
  


#### Why am I doing this?

#### How does this reflect my brand?

#### What do I hope to get out of this project?

#### What do I want my audience to get out of this project?

Asking yourself these questions can help you to lay the foundation of what you&#8217;re working on, whether it be a project, product, organization or website.

Observing your own intentions is something you need to do before starting something new.
