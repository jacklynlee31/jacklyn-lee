## What&#8217;s in it for me?

You have to know why you are writing the e-mail in the first place. What are you offering? How is your e-mail going to help this other person? What are you trying to get out of it and, in return, what are you willing to give to them? Every e-mail must have a purpose. <a href="http://www.jacklyn-lee.com/start-with-reflection/" target="_blank">Take a little time to think about what you want</a> and how your e-mail is going to further that goal.

## Look over here!

The subject of an e-mail is everything. Don&#8217;t use anything generic. Instead, think of it as a book or blog title. You want something eye-catching. You want your reader to immediately click on your e-mail &#8211; you want them to read more. Avoid subject lines that sound like spam. If I don&#8217;t know the person, and the subject e-mail sounds weird, there is a good chance I&#8217;ll delete the e-mail without opening it.

## I&#8217;m not reading that.

There is nothing worse than a long e-mail. I know many people who delete long e-mails that show up in their inbox without even reading them. Know what you&#8217;re going to say, and keep it simple. Get to the point!

## Did you spell that right?

Spelling or grammar mistakes in an e-mail can make you look unprofessional. Make sure you read over your e-mail before you send it. There is nothing worse than sending a mass e-mail out to your coworkers before realizing you spelled someone&#8217;s name wrong. Not good.

## What&#8217;s your number?

Is an e-mail really the best way to get your point across? Sometimes it helps to talk to that person face to face, especially if it&#8217;s a personal issue. Other times a quick phone call can answer your question instead of sending another e-mail to an already-full inbox. If you&#8217;re saying thank you after an interview or after receiving a gift, <a href="http://www.jacklyn-lee.com/write-better-thank-you-notes/" target="_blank">consider handwriting a thank you note instead</a>.
