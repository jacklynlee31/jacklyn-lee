In order to stand out from the crowd it can be smart to find a specialty or niche to push you forward and give you an edge in your business. Finding your niche can be advantageous for artists, writers, bloggers, designers, coaches, and more!

Although it can be scary to think about, there are a lot of people out there that are in the same field as you. **But remember: there is only one you!** Finding your niche can strengthen your brand, and confirm your passion.  
&nbsp;   
**Try New Things and Retry Old Things**   
Finding your niche requires you to step out of your comfort zone. If there is something that has always interested you, try it! If there is something that you did in the past that still interests you today, try it again! You may end up rekindling a passion for writing stories, drawing, solving problems, or something else!  
**  
** **What do you love?**  
Take out of a piece of paper or open a new document. Now start writing down what you love to do. Don&#8217;t think too hard about it (you shouldn&#8217;t have to!) and write down anything and everything that comes to mind. On my list I had down books, movies, superheroes, and Hello Kitty, to name a few.

Does that mean I&#8217;m going to start a Hello Kitty business? Not likely, but it&#8217;s important to write down everything. Who knows &#8211; the style or color of Hello Kitty could end up inspiring a new design project.  
**  
** **What are you good at?**  
Still have that list up? Go through and circle the things that you&#8217;re awesome at.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important to do this with a little discretion. A few weeks ago I would have put &#8216;design&#8217; on my love list but not circled it. Now that I&#8217;m learning more about design everyday, however, I can safely circle it knowing that although I&#8217;m not the greatest, I can only get better.****  
**  
** **Practice makes perfect.**  
Once you know what you love and what you&#8217;re good at, it&#8217;s time to work it. Write everyday. Draw a new picture everyday. <a href="https://giveit100.com/" target="_blank"><b>Take the ultimate challenge and practice for 100 days.</b></a> Keep on going, even when you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re doing well, or when it&#8217;s hard. Each step is a step forward.

**Keep your niche.**  
Say you finally figured out your niche. Maybe it&#8217;s writing children&#8217;s stories, filming black and white movies, or making jewelry out of found objects. The important thing now is to keep going even when it&#8217;s hard. Keep practicing. **<a href="http://www.jacklyn-lee.com/stop-second-guessing-yourself/" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t second guess yourself.</a>** Maybe your niche needs tweaking in the future, but don&#8217;t throw everything away in one moment of doubt.

Keep going forward, embrace your niche, and take the world by storm!
