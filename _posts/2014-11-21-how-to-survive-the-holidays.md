I love the holidays. I love opening presents on Christmas Day, eating good food on Thanksgiving and spending time with my friends and family. However, not all of us love the holiday season. Many people work through the holidays or don&#8217;t live near family or friends that they can spend time with. With the cold weather and grey skies, some people feel down during the holiday season and don&#8217;t want to get out of bed. Thankfully, there are some ways to give yourself a little boost during this time of year.

## Let&#8217;s talk about how to survive the holidays&#8230;

&nbsp;

#### Give yourself something to look forward to.

Is there an event coming up that you are planning on attending? Maybe there&#8217;s a new movie or video game coming out that you can&#8217;t wait for, or maybe you can&#8217;t wait until the break so you can fly home to see your family. Set your sights on something fun.

#### Embrace the holiday cheese.

I&#8217;m not talking about the food. I&#8217;m talking about the cheesy aspects of the holiday that always pop up this time of year. One of my favorite things to do is watch Hallmark movies with my Mom. They are usually horrible, but that makes it even more fun. Sing some goofy Christmas carols, make a paper turkey or sit down and watch a holiday classic.

#### Look for free opportunities.

If you look in your local paper, there is usually a section highlighting all of the events going on in your state or city. Pick out some that look fun and go to them! There are usually a bunch of free events going on during the season where you can do something new and get some good food.

#### Amp up the atmosphere.

Put on some holiday music when you&#8217;re at home. Light a warm fire. Wrap yourself up in a warm blanket and drink apple cider. Do all of the holiday things you&#8217;ve always wanted to do.

#### Decorate.

Go to your local Dollar Store and go crazy with decorations. Whether it be tiny turkeys, green and red streamers or mini Christmas trees, your house (or room) deserves to be festive!

#### Pamper your pets.

Your pets deserve presents, too! Buy your furry friend a holiday outfit or his/her favorite treat to put in a little stocking. Give your pets some extra love during the holidays.

#### Get together with some friends.

If you have friends in the area, call them up and plan a holiday party! Have each person bring a different holiday treat or have everyone wear a tacky sweater. Better yet, if your friends are all alone for the holidays, get together for a gift swap or a potluck dinner.

#### Practice gratitude.

Sometimes what you need is a little perspective. Take time this season to think about all of the things in your life that you are thankful for. Write it down and hang it up somewhere where you can see it and add to it everyday.

#### Buy yourself a present.

You worked hard this year! 2014 is almost over, and you survived! Splurge a little bit and buy yourself that gift you have always wanted. You deserve it.

#### Take care of yourself.

Remember to do the little things this season, like brush your teeth, wash your face and do your laundry. Listen to your body and make sure to take care of it. Take medicine when you need to, settle down with a hot bath and a good book or take that nap you desperately need. The holidays can be hard for a lot of people. If you&#8217;re feeling down this season, don&#8217;t hesitate to put yourself first.
