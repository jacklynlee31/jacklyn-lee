&#8220;Whenever my intuition speaks up, I listen. I&#8217;m in service to her, continually strengthening our connection and honoring her cues. She&#8217;s always nudging me, guiding me, and telling me when it&#8217;s a GO and when it&#8217;s a pause. She never leads me astray. My only role is to listen.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://heyamberrae.com/post/84770253284/following-intuition-is-like-building-a-muscle-the#disqus_thread" target="_blank">Following Intuition by Amber Rae.</a>
