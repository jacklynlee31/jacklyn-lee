    The last few months have been transformative.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My journey actually started last year, when I started taking steps toward self-realization. I wanted to know more about myself and how I could connect with the world around me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But I was all talk. Despite reading numerous articles and books on ‘changing your life’ or ‘inspiration,’ I wasn’t able to put the words into action. My life still felt dull. I started 2015 unemployed, frustrated and closed off to the world and what it was trying to tell me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I wish I could pinpoint the day that everything started to make sense, but I can’t. It’s been a long journey and I am nowhere near the end. However, I am excited for this journey and have already started embracing new things.

## + **Started to ask myself questions.** 

This has been the most important thing I have incorporated into my life. Whenever I have a thought or feeling I take a moment, embrace it, and ask myself ‘Why?&#8217;

What am I feeling in this moment?

Why am I frustrated right now?

Why am I tired?

Why does my body feel like it’s rejecting me?

These questions have taken me forward to learn more about my emotions and my physical and mental health. In February I took the challenge of eliminating soda and fast food from my diet and it taught me a lot about what my body needs and wants.Which brings me to my next point&#8230;

## + **Started listening to myself.**

I read an interesting article that made me realize that my emotions are not the enemy. I am not my mind. Instead of rejecting those emotions or just ‘getting over it’ like some people say to do, I am embracing them. When you are mad or sad or frustrated, your body is trying to tell you something important.

The same goes with health. I started to pay attention to how my body reacted to eating certain foods. Interestingly enough, my body didn’t always react well to ‘healthy’ foods and didn’t always reject ‘bad’ foods. It is still a balancing act, but I am making small steps forward.

## + **Started letting go.** 

Being unemployed is difficult. For awhile I was wondering if I was going about everything the right way. But the minute I started to let go and trust that the right job or opportunity was coming my way, I got an exciting phone call about an upcoming opportunity. Sometimes you have to stop pushing and let the world lead you forward.

## + **Started sharing.** 

I have been very good about asking questions and sharing my wants and fears with others. However, I’ve been putting off sharing those things with my friends and family, the people that really understand me. This post is the first step toward sharing myself with you, whoever you may be. My hope is that you will be inspired, somehow, by the words I share here.

I am still on my journey and learning to embrace the different facets of my life.

In my last post I shared that I want to feel creative, centered, connected and electric.

What I really want to do is **EMBRACE life**.

**EMBRACE** my emotions.

**EMBRACE** new situations and relationships.

**EMBRACE** fear.

I invite you to finish this sentence:
