I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I am not a patient person. I have always prided myself on getting things done quickly, whether it be finishing work in class or writing an article for work.

But there is a reason why slow and steady wins the race.

Last week my coworker pulled me aside and pointed out some mistakes I made on a story. I was mortified. Most of the mistakes were spelling or grammar errors. They were things I would have caught&#8230;if I hadn&#8217;t been going so fast.

For the next story, I took my time and made each change deliberately. I thought about each choice before I made it. Did it take me longer? Yes. But did I finish with a much better story? Yes.

Slowing down is also important when it comes to your health.

Once, in college, I decided that I wanted to try to go vegan. I went to the store and bought fake cheese, threw out all of my non-vegan food and went cold turkey.

And guess what?

After a few days I was chowing down on a burger.

Why did that happen?

It&#8217;s because I went too fast. I was looking at the endgame, but I wasn&#8217;t taking the time to establish a good foundation before I started my journey.

Now I&#8217;ve been focusing on taking small, deliberate steps to improve my personal and physical health. I have a set morning routine. I drink more water and I&#8217;m starting to phase sodas out of my life (Diet Coke, I&#8217;ll miss you.) A few weeks ago I focused on eating at least one &#8216;good&#8217; meal a day and now I&#8217;m working my way to two &#8216;good&#8217; meals.

Is it working?

Yes!

So the next time you&#8217;re working on something, whether it be for yourself or for your work, don&#8217;t be afraid to take your time. [Establish a good, strong foundation before starting something new. Good work is always better than rushed work.](http://ctt.ec/zG6gU)
