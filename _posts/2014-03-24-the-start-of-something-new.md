  I used to think that I was at a dead-end in my life.&nbsp; I would imagine walking down a path only to hit a wall of trees, thinking that I had to turn around and try again.
</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  Yesterday I realized that what I had actually been doing was going down the exact same path over and over again.&nbsp; I was reaching the wall only to turn around and hit that same wall a few weeks later.

  It was time to change, and time to get off of this path.&nbsp; Now I am &#8211; slowly but surely &#8211; reaching forward through the trees that I thought would be my demise.&nbsp; I am on a path that feels uncomfortable and hard, but <b>I know in my heart that this is where I need to go</b>.

  <b>This isn&#8217;t a dead-end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  <b>This is just the beginning.</b>
