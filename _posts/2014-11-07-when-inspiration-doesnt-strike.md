  This past week I have learned that you can&#8217;t force inspiration.
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
  <p style="clear: both;">
    No matter how many times I turned on an inspiring playlist or got comfortable with a pen and paper, I always found myself staring at a blank page or an empty screen.
  </p>
  
  <p style="clear: both;">
    <p style="clear: both;">
      I had no idea how to continue.
    </p>
    
    <p style="clear: both;">
      <p style="clear: both;">
        I didn&#8217;t even know how to start.
      </p>
      
      <div style="clear: both;">
      </div>
      
      <h2 style="clear: both;">
        When inspiration is lacking, I have learned that change is often the answer.
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        Go out of your element. Seek out a new environment. Try a bustling coffee shop or a picnic table at your nearby park. Listen to the sounds around you and observe your surroundings. Don&#8217;t worry about writing or checking another item off of your to-do list.
      </p>
      
      <p style="clear: both;">
        <p style="clear: both;">
          Spend some time with yourself. Turn off your phone and spend at least a half hour sitting, standing or walking in a peaceful place.
        </p>
        
        <p style="clear: both;">
          <p style="clear: both;">
            <i>Take a break from the familiar</i>.
          </p>
          
          <p style="clear: both;">
            <p style="clear: both;">
              Inspiration will come. It may come slowly or it may come all at once, but it will eventually come. And when inspiration does strike? When you get a new idea or figure out exactly what you&#8217;ve been trying to say? You&#8217;ll know. You&#8217;ll feel it in your soul and in your bones.
            </p>

                This weekend, take a few hours to slow down and listen to what life is telling you.
              </p>
              
              <p style="clear: both;">
                <p style="clear: both;">
                  You have what you need.
                </p>
                
                <h2 style="clear: both;">
                  Now go be awesome.
