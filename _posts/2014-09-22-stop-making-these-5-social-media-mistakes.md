  Whether you&#8217;re unemployed and searching for a job or currently employed with an awesome company, social media is important. It can connect you with the best parts of the internet&#8230;and it can also keep you from getting that job you love (or even get you fired!)

If you&#8217;re making any of the five social media mistakes below, it may be time to reconstruct your online presence before it gets you into trouble.

#### **Do you post about drinking, drugs or other activities?**

Everyone likes to have fun. However, there&#8217;s a huge difference between posting about mimosas with your girlfriends and posting about that party you went to last weekend where you blacked out. Some things just don&#8217;t need to be shared, and if a potential employer sees that post on your page, it could stop you from getting the job. It&#8217;s also something to avoid if you&#8217;re currently employed with a company. Whether you like it or not, you represent that company through your social media pages.

**NOTE:** If you are underage, don&#8217;t even think about it. Posting about the illegal things you did last weekend will come back to bite you.

#### **Are you posting inappropriate photos?**

You would be amazed at the amount of people I knew in college who would post dozens of pictures from their wild night out. Am I telling you to stop having fun? No, but posting a picture of you drinking or doing something illegal (you&#8217;d be surprised what I&#8217;ve seen) is not something you want your boss stumbling upon while he/she is checking out your Facebook Photo Albums.

#### **Are you posting hateful things on the internet?**

We already have enough problems when it comes to bullying on the internet. Don&#8217;t contribute to the problem. While I do speak my mind on the internet, I try to shy away from comment wars or getting into hateful discussions. If you do feel strongly about something and feel you need to speak your mind, it may be better to send that person a polite message. Facebook comments are a prime example. People love to comment on Facebook posts and nine times out of ten they get carried away. Sometimes it can be better to keep it to yourself.

#### **Do you post on social media about how much you hate your job?**

Please don&#8217;t post about how much you hate your job on social media. Don&#8217;t post about that coworker that annoys you and definitely don&#8217;t post about your boss. If you don&#8217;t like your job, text it to a friend or find a new job. You&#8217;d be surprised at how fast that kind of stuff gets back to the people you work with.

#### **Are you even on social media?**

Despite all of the precautions, social media is important. It can help you network with potential employers and connect with new and old friends. It can help you to share information and can open up a world of opportunities.

When it comes down to it, your posts, tweets and photos are all online. They are not as private as you think. You&#8217;d be amazed at the people I know personally who have gotten fired or have gotten in trouble due to comments made on social media.

Do you use social media like Facebook or Twitter? What are some other things you think people should stop doing on their social media accounts? **Discuss in the comments below!**
