&#8220;When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.&#8221; &nbsp;The classic quote that we all hear time and time again. As children we were told to take what life throws at us and spin it into something positive and beautiful.

In this day and age, however, lemonade doesn&#8217;t seem to be enough.

We are taught from a young age to finish school, go to college, get an &#8216;adult&#8217; job and work until we retire. &nbsp;But this is 2013. &nbsp;We are no longer confined to a life of school and work. 

More people are deciding to <a href="http://exilelifestyle.com/" target="_blank">travel the world</a> or <a href="http://heyamberrae.com/" target="_blank">quit their job to pursue their true passions</a>. &nbsp;Start-up companies are becoming the new norm, and they are not satisfied by a simple glass of lemonade. &nbsp;They want you to take your lemons and make something exciting. &nbsp;They want to see what you can do with what you are given, and normal is not enough.

Companies want you to tell a story with your life; a story that excites them and, more importantly, excites YOU.

Life is about taking chances and challenging the status quo. &nbsp;If your passion is to travel the world, find a way to do it, even if you are young and broke. &nbsp;If your passion is to start a blog, **start NOW**. &nbsp;Forget about the things that are stopping you. &nbsp;You will never be more alive or capable than you are now.

So the next time life throws something at you, step out of your comfort zone and see what you can create. &nbsp;Life is full of possibilities, and it is up to you to discover them.
