&nbsp;Every Wednesday is &#8216;Work it Wednesday&#8217; &#8211; I tell you what I&#8217;m working on and I give you links to help you get your work on this week!

Wednesdays are for working it, and this week I&#8217;ve been working on my design skills again. My main project has been helping my sister re-design her blog with all-new header, links and color scheme to help with branding.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a fun project, and something I plan on finishing today.

**get your work on //**

One of the best links I&#8217;ve come across this week has been <a href="http://www.karenx.com/blog/how-to-become-a-designer-without-going-to-design-school/" target="_blank">How to Become a Designer without going to Design School</a>. Karen X. Cheng lists out important steps like &#8216;Learn how to Draw&#8217; and &#8216;Learn Specialties&#8217; while offering a list of essential resources for any designer. I&#8217;ve been following her advice the past week, and it&#8217;s really helped me to advance my own skills and get a clearer picture of what I want out of my future as a designer.

&#8220;What matters now is that in this brave new world, we’ve been given the chance to reinvent ourselves. We’ve been given the tools and the access. And once you go past the daring cat videos and Sharkeisha Vines, you’ll start to realize it’s exciting, it’s unreal, and it’s insane.&#8221;
