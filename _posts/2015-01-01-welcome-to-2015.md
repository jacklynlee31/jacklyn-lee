Welcome to 2015.

**How do you want to feel this year?**

You know _what you want to do_.

You want to lose 15 pounds.

You want to travel.

You want to read 100 books or start exercising more or get married.

But those things aren&#8217;t important.

This year, don&#8217;t focus on what you want to do.

## **Focus on how you want to feel.**

Instead of trying to lose ten pounds, focus on doing things that make you feel healthy. Maybe that&#8217;s drinking more water or cutting fast food out of your diet.

Instead of telling yourself you&#8217;re going to write a book, focus on doing things that make you feel creative. That could entail writing every day, reading more or taking a writing class.

Instead of telling yourself you want to get married, focus on doing things that make you feel love. Maybe that doesn&#8217;t mean getting married just yet. Maybe it just means spending more time with your partner.

The problem with setting New Year&#8217;s Resolutions is that by the end of January they usually fade and we give them up. You miss a day of running and you immediately feel guilty. Guilt has no place in your goals.

So this year, in 2015, instead of focusing on goals, focus on feelings. How do you want to feel? Pull out a piece of paper or open a new Word document and start brainstorming. You can also write down your goals and try matching them to certain feelings. For example: Eat more vegetables = healthy, Write a book = creative.

If you&#8217;re having trouble picking out how you want to feel this year, I recommend picking up <a href="http://www.daniellelaporte.com/" target="_blank">The Desire Map by Danielle LaPorte</a>. It&#8217;s an excellent resource for figuring out your desired feelings.

## **This year I want to feel creative, connected, centered and electric.**

## **What about you?**
