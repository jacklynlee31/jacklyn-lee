To fill up my free time, I&#8217;ve been working on my design skills in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve realized that messing around with graphic design is actually really fun for me, and kind of calming.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve sent out some proposals to people here and there, and I have an appointment tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been working on logo designs, book cover designs and business card designs (see above).

**// get your work on**

**<a href="http://design.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Tuts+ has been a lifesaver the past few days</a>**.&nbsp; I&#8217;m familiar with InDesign and Photoshop, but learning Illustrator has been interesting, to say the least.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re a designer, and you&#8217;re looking to learn something new or practice your skills, check this website out.

**<a href="http://rebelswithacause.co/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">The ebook Rebels With a Cause</a>** helped me to really stick to what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past few weeks.&nbsp; Sometimes when I start something new, I find my passion waning when I don&#8217;t get fast results.&nbsp; Rebels With a Cause was the reminder I needed to keep on going.

**<a href="http://www.sarahvonbargen.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Von Bargen</a>** has her own links and articles that are all must-reads for bloggers and entrepreneurs&#8230;.and pretty much everyone else, too!

**What are you working on this Wednesday?**
