This is your life, in all of it&#8217;s wonderful, chaotic, incredible, stressful, messed-up glory.

When you hold a sleeping newborn, climb a tree, hug an old friend, fall in love, swim in the ocean, finish reading a good book, or smile so hard that your face hurts?

This is your life.

When you lose your job, break up with someone, cry until your chest hurts, fall out of someone&#8217;s life, break a bone, make a mistake, or feel completely and utterly tired?

This is your life.

During the good times and the bad times. Whether your life is sailing along or you wish it would sail a little faster, this is your life.

This is your life right now, _and that is okay_.  
**  
** Your life may not be anything like you planned it. You may be looking around you and wondering how you got here.

And that is okay.

We are humans and we screw up a lot. &nbsp;Never apologize for living life on your terms. Don&#8217;t apologize for doing things the best you can or for taking time out for yourself.

**This is your life right now, and that is OK.**
