**Who are you?&nbsp; What do you do?&nbsp; What is your story?** 

<div>
</div>

<div>
  We are asked these questions all of the time.&nbsp; As human beings we are enthralled by the human condition and what makes us ‘us’.&nbsp; We want to know how other people define themselves so we can, in turn, define ourselves.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  When is the last time you told your story?
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Telling your story can be difficult.&nbsp; It can force you to pull up things about yourself that you may not necessarily like.&nbsp; Perhaps your story doesn’t seem to be headed to a happy ending.&nbsp; Your story may seem more like a tragedy, or a dark comedy.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  However dark your story may seem to be, telling your story in some form is important for not only others, but also for yourself.

<div>
  <b>Know Where you’re Going</b>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Your story is your journey.&nbsp; There are multiple paths that you can choose to walk on, and each path leads to a different outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  What path are you on right now?&nbsp; Where is that path leading you?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Do you feel good about the path you are walking down right now in your life?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  If you don’t feel good about the path you are on right now, why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  What can you do to change your direction?&nbsp; It may be time to take a detour.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <b>Inspire Others to Act</b>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Telling your story is important not only for you, but also for those around you.&nbsp; Hearing other people’s stories can inspire you to act, and the same can happen if you tell your story.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  You may think that your story is not inspiring, but you never know what someone else will take from hearing your struggles and accomplishments.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  What struggles have you gone through in your life to get you to where you are now?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  What accomplishments can you brag about?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  What advice can you give to others through telling your story?
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
  <b>Strengthen your Identity</b>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Who are you?&nbsp; Telling your story can help to answer this question.&nbsp; Take note of your strengths and your values.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  What do you find to be important?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  How have you utilized your strengths to get you to where you are today?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  By telling your story, whether it be to yourself or to others, you can start to pinpoint what in your life gives you joy and what is merely ‘so-so’.&nbsp; Focus on what is important in your life and what you love to do in order to start becoming the person you were meant to be.
