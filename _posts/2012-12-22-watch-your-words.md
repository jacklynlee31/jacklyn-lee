Actions don&#8217;t always speak louder than words. &nbsp;Sometimes it what you say, how you say it, and who you say it to that really matters. &nbsp;I have seen firsthand the consequences that come with saying things that shouldn&#8217;t be said, so this holiday season and into the New Year, please remember:

**Your words have the potential to build someone up or break them down. &nbsp;**  
**  
** Your words are yours and no one else&#8217;s. &nbsp;Please use them carefully, and think before you speak. &nbsp;The next time you speak about yourself or others, please be sure that your intentions are pure. &nbsp;Avoid gossip and slander, and use your words for kindness and love instead.
