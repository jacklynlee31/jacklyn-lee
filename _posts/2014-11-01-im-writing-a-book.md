You heard me.

Right now I am sitting in a library, snuggled up inside one of the study rooms. Computer in front of me, notebook and pen to my right, music playing through my earphones.

This month I am participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">Nanowrimo, National Novel Writing Month</a>. I will be writing 50,000 words in the month of November.

Am I insane? Possibly.  
Am I excited? Definitely.

I&#8217;ve stuck with one idea and now I get to see it come to life. I love seeing my characters jump off the page.

I&#8217;m keeping my idea under wraps for now, but just know that it&#8217;s a little bit of science fiction, a little bit of romance and a little bit of rebellion.

It&#8217;s not too late to participate in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">Nanowrimo</a>! Check out the website if you&#8217;re interested, and look up &#8216;Jacklyn Lee&#8217; if you want to be writing buddies or check out my progress.

**Happy writing, everyone!**
