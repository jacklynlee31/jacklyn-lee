I love thank you notes. A text message or e-mail is fine, but getting a letter in the mail telling you how awesome you are? Sign me up!

A thank you note is one of the best ways to express your thanks to a friend or family member in a special, unique way. If you&#8217;ve never written a thank you note before, now is the time!

#### Who do you want to thank today?

<div>
  Maybe you want to thank a family member for sending you that awesome birthday gift or you want to express some gratitude to a friend &#8216;just because.&#8217; Thinking about who you are sending your note to is the first step. Stop for a moment and scribble down a &#8216;gratitude list&#8217; of people who deserve your thanks. Choose one, two or three people from the list. Choose them all! You can never tell someone &#8216;thank you&#8217; enough.</p>
</div>

#### Speak from the Heart

<div>
  Don&#8217;t just sign your name to a random card you pick up at the store &#8211; no one likes a generic thank you note. Why are you thanking this person? What do they mean to you? Write it down, and don&#8217;t be afraid to be sappy, especially if it&#8217;s for someone older. My Grandma loves getting thank you notes. The sappier the better!</p>
</div>

#### Get in the Habit

<div>
  I am so thankful that my Mom sat me down and made me write thank you notes after my birthdays and after Christmas. When I was younger it felt unbearable, having to sit there and meticulously write personalized thank you notes to all of these people. Now I love it. I still remind myself to send the little notes out. I love doing it, and my friends and family love receiving them. Get in the habit of writing thank you notes. Expressing gratitude is good for you and good for them. It&#8217;s a win-win situation.</p>
</div>
