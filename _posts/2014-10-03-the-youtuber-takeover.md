No, it&#8217;s not a new boy band or hot young movie star, it&#8217;s online celebrities. YouTubers are the latest band of creators making news.&nbsp;</span>If you&#8217;re new to the YouTuber scene, or if you can&#8217;t figure out how or why this rising medium is catching on, here&#8217;s 5 reasons why you might want to tune in.</span>

#### **<span style="font-family: inherit;">There&#8217;s Something For Everyone</span>**

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Whether you&#8217;re searching for beauty tips, life advice, or just a good laugh, there&#8217;s certainly a YouTube channel out there for you.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Macbarbie07" target="_blank">Bethany Mota</a>&nbsp;(who graces the cover of that new Seventeen Magazine) is one of the most popular beauty gurus on the &#8216;Tube. She shares hairstyling and make up tips, and overall fashion advice that garners millions of views per video. Zoe Sugg, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zoella280390" target="_blank">Zoella</a>&nbsp;as she&#8217;s known to her fans, is also an adorable fashionista. But if they&#8217;re not what you&#8217;re looking for, maybe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFineBros" target="_blank">TheFineBros</a>&nbsp;are. Benny and Rafi bring you quick paced clever comedy in many forms, including getting kids and elders to react to viral videos and fads. This is just the tip of the iceberg with what you can find on YouTube, obviously, but the idea is that there&#8217;s a little something for everyone.&nbsp;</span>

#### **<span style="font-family: inherit;">They&#8217;re Real People Who Want to Meet You</span>**

<span style="font-family: inherit;">These YouTubers&#8217; videos gain millions of views and comments, building fan bases comparable to those of major celebrities. But unlike those A-listers who seem untouchable and unreachable, YouTubers are relatively a young, friendly bunch who just happened to make it big online. Many of them use their YouTubes and Twitters and Tumblrs to connect on a one-on-one level with their fans. Also, conventions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vidcon" target="_blank">VidCon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://thedigitour.com/" target="_blank">Digi TourÂ </a>bring YouTubers and their adoring fans together for panels and meet ups and special events that make the YouTube community more like a family.</span>

#### **<span style="font-family: inherit;">Making a Difference Beyond the Screen</span>**

<span style="font-family: inherit;">YouTubers are making huge differences in the world. Many of them are inspiring and spurring change within their community. For example, best-selling author of The Fault in Our Stars, and popular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers" target="_blank">YouTuber John Green</a>&nbsp;asked his followers to donate at&nbsp;<a href="http://water.org/" target="_blank">water.org&nbsp;</a>to help get clean water to families in Ethiopia. At last check, he and his fans had raised over $200,000. Earlier this year, YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tyleroakley" target="_blank">Tyler Oakley</a>&nbsp;asked his viewers to donate to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thetrevorproject.org/" target="_blank">The Trevor Project</a>&nbsp;instead of sending him presents for his birthday. The organization, which helps LGBTQ youth, received over half a million dollars from Oakley&#8217;s fundraiser.</span>

#### **<span style="font-family: inherit;">YouTube Is Creating Business and Opportunity</span>**

<span style="font-family: inherit;">These entertainers are making bank. They&#8217;re bringing home the bacon by producing and posting videos and gaining views, something that would&#8217;ve seemed unheard of or impossible just a few years ago. One of YouTube&#8217;s biggest stars,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie" target="_blank">Pew Die Pie</a>, pulls in a reported $4 million a year. But how do videos equal cash? There are a few ways, but the biggest is clearly advertising. The site splits the ad revenue with individual channels. The YouTubers can also team up with a company, supplying the brand with a type of sponsorship.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.business2community.com/youtube/youtubers-make-money-0874191" target="_blank">This article lays out some more ways channels can make money.&nbsp;</a></span>

#### **<span style="font-family: inherit;">Inspiring a Generation</span>**

<span style="font-family: inherit;">It&#8217;s not hard to see why this growing form of entertainment is catching on and gaining more and more attention. New channels are popping up every single day with baby YouTubers giving this medium their best shot. They see that these people, often times who are their age, are using their talents and gifts to create, entertain, and give back. If you&#8217;re thinking about giving it your best shot, what better people to ask for advice than YouTubers themselves?</span>
