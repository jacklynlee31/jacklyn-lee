As many of you know, I spent the month of November participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">Nanowrimo, National Novel Writing Month</a>.

It feels like November 1st was yesterday. I spent night after night huddled up in my room, writing a book that I thought was going to be amazing.

But then something happened.

_I lost interest._

Losing interest is typical when writing a long piece. I continued to move forward, writing detailed scenes and long patches of dialogue. I was up on the word count I was doing well.

Until I woke up one morning and realized that my resistance to writing the novel didn&#8217;t have to do with procrastination or writer&#8217;s block.

## **My resistance had everything to do with passion.**

I didn&#8217;t like what I was writing. Although the concept excited me, as I started the piece every word felt like a struggle. I felt like I was lying to my readers. My characters lacked strength and my writing lacked soul.

I know now that I have to write what sets my soul on fire. Unfortunately, I was writing a book that didn&#8217;t give me those feelings. But I am convinced that I am a better, more organized writer because of it. In the future, my aim is to truly write words that will inspire you, my readers, to live lives that you love.

## **I hope you are spending your time doing something that sets your soul on fire.**
