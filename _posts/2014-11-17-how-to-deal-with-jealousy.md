When is the last time you were jealous of someone? Was it someone on television or was it someone you knew personally? Has jealousy ever ruined a friendship in your life or caused you to hurt someone&#8217;s feelings?

Jealousy can be a horrible thing. A touch of envy can turn into a storm that you can&#8217;t control. Try some of these tips below to stop the flow of jealousy. Don&#8217;t let it run your life.

## How to Deal with Jealousy

#### Practice Gratitude

One of the best ways to combat jealousy is to start appreciating what you already have. Every day write down 10 things you are grateful for. They can be as simple as getting to pet your cat or having a good commute to work. Start becoming aware of all the good things in your life instead of focusing on the things you don&#8217;t have.

#### Work for What you Want

The majority of people who have nice things worked hard to get them. If you want that new purse or want to travel the world, start working for it. That friend you have that got to go to Greece over the summer? Stop staring at her Facebook photos and take action. Take measurable, conscious steps toward your goal. When you work hard for the things that you want, it feels so much better when you finally get it.

#### You Will Never Be \___\____ (and that&#8217;s okay)

Kate Winslet is my favorite actress. I think she is insanely talented and gorgeous. Unfortunately, no matter how much I try, I will never be Kate Winslet, and neither will you. No matter how much you idolize someone, you will never be them. You will, however, always be you. Embrace who you are. Embrace your flaws and talents and realize that it is okay to be you.

#### People are just People

Let&#8217;s get real for a minute here: everybody poops. Sorry, but it&#8217;s true. The actors, models and musicians that you love and idolize. The girl in your class who seems to always get the guy. The guy who just got that brand new sports car. At the end of the day, we really aren&#8217;t that different.

#### Things are just Things

A few years ago there was this big trend of wearing these small, multi-colored bracelets that came in all different color combinations and styles. I remember going with a friend of mine and picking up two or three, each of them about $12 each, and sporting them proudly on my arm. Do I still have those bracelets? Yes. Do I still wear them? Not really. The trend is over, and my taste has changed. Things go out of style and things break. Before you shell out $400 on a purse you saw an actress wear on the red carpet, maybe you need to take a few days to assess if you really need another &#8216;thing&#8217; in your life.
