# You are a writer.

It doesn’t matter what you write. It could be blog posts, e-books, or articles. What matters is that you put your pen to paper or your hands to the keys and write what you love.

But what if you aren’t writing what you love?

#### What if you’re writing to please others?

What if you&#8217;re just writing what you think will get you more followers? More views? More likes?

You want people to realize that you are an artist. You want to be one of those writers people admire. You want to be authentic, but you have no idea where to begin.

## I’m Jacklyn Lee.

#### I’m the creator of this corner of the internet, and I am a wordsmith.

Wordsmith
  
noun | word-smith
  
: a person who works with words; especially: a skillful writer

My main focus is editing. I take your words and make them into something magical. I help you find your voice, find your passion, and find your authenticity.

### Why do I do it?

Because a few years ago, I was you. I knew that my writing had the opportunity to inspire those around me, so I started this website.

It was a process of trial and error.

However, I learned that the way to connect with people was to be genuine and authentic instead of worrying what would get me the most likes.

I learned that although I love writing, my real love is helping other people love their own words.

### And now, I guide writers like you to a place of clarity.

#### I help you get real results.

<div>
   The kind that makes people put down your e-book and think, “Wow, my sister has to read this.&#8221;
</div>

The kind that makes you lean back in your chair, overwhelmed with focus and inspiration.

The kind that can help you change the world with the most powerful weapon anyone can wield: your words.

## You are already amazing.
