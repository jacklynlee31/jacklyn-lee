## About Jacklyn

I started Jacklyn-Lee.com in 2010 with the tagline &#8216;Inspire & Be  Inspired.&#8217; Although my tagline has changed, my mission remains the same:

# To create a space where  readers can be inspired to be  their best selves.

I am a 23 year old living in the South. When I&#8217;m not dreaming about one day living in California, I&#8217;m either reading, writing, watching Netflix or hanging out with the love of my life: my cat Dolly. I love to search for new ways to live and communicate more effectively.

This website is about living an awesome life. For me, this includes  writing, so I make sure to teach you how to be a better writer. I also  share things that I&#8217;ve learned in my own search for happiness and  clarity.

## I am always looking for inspiration.

Don&#8217;t be afraid to [contact me](mailto:jacklynlee31@gmail.com "Let’s Chat") if you have any questions or if you just  want me to check out your website!
